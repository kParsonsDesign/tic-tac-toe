# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React
> Week 16 MIT Full Stack Professional Certificate Program

## Description
- Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React.
- Have a simple game that fills a square with either an "X" or an "O" based on player turn.
- Player turns alternate on click.
- Each square can only be clicked on once (it cannot be reassigned to another player).
- When a row or a column or a diaganal is filled with marks from a single player, that player wins.
- If the game board is filled with no win, then it is considered a draw.

### Refactoring:
- Using Bootstrap for most css style control.
- Added a score tracking feature to keep track of total wins per player.
- Added a "Clear Game" button and a "New Game" button to reset the game board. At the moment both buttons are necessary to start a new game. Refreshing the page wipes out the wins tracking.

## To Run
This project can be viewed on a browser at [kparsonsdesign.github.io/tic-tac-toe/](https://kparsonsdesign.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## Roadmap
- Will try to merge the functionality of the "Clear Game" and "New Game" buttons into one single reset button.
